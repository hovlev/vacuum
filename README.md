# vacuum

npm i, npm start, navigate to localhost:7007 and enjoy your vacuuming!

To control the vacuum use the keyboard cursors (or click the tile above, below, left or right of the vacuum), black squares are walls, brown squares are dirty tiles. Some tiles need a little more effort than others (try moving back and forward over them).
